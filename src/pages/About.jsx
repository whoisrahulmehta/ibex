        Chapter 1: The Enchantment of Himalayan Landscapes Imagine standing at
        the foothills of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, its
        snow-capped summit piercing the cerulean sky. The Himalayas stretch
        across six countries—Nepal, India, Bhutan, Tibet (China), Pakistan, and
        Afghanistan—each offering its own unique terrain and charm. From the
        lush greenery of the Annapurna region in Nepal to the arid expanses of
        Ladakh in India, IBEX unveils landscapes that range from verdant valleys
        to stark deserts, providing a canvas for every traveler's dream.
